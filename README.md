bugs
bug: when i originally built my first initial function, i was testing my attribute buttons to with alerts to make sure the iteration and code was working. Nothing was happening at all, i tried changing the values of my data-choices etc. I ran the code on JQuery, it identified there was a problem with line 71. Solution: i had all of my projects below my code, i commented them out, tested again and it worked. my alerts were working!
